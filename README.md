## Introduction

3D graphics play an indispensable role in a variety of applications such as video games, animated films, simulations, and even website design. One technology that has considerably lowered the barrier to entry in the field of 3D graphics for the web is the JavaScript library known as three.js. I was intrigued by the talk of Servin, a freelancer and full-stack developer who founded his own company called Level 30 Wizards, which is a creative digital studio. This inspired me to write this article.

## Understanding the 3D Graphics World
3D Graphics, or three-dimensional graphics, provide a sense of depth, perspective, and spatial relationships that two-dimensional (2D) graphics can't offer. In contrast to 2D graphics, which are flat and lack a z-axis, 3D graphics have length, breadth, and depth, represented by x, y, and z coordinates, respectively.

3D graphics are created by transforming and rendering geometric data, often in the form of polygons, in a three-dimensional space. Lighting, shading, texturing, and other techniques are then applied to these polygons to give them a realistic appearance.

## A Deeper Look into three.js
three.js is a JavaScript library that enables developers to create and display 3D graphics on a web browser. It was created to abstract and simplify the complexity of WebGL (Web Graphics Library), the primary technology used in modern web browsers to generate 3D graphics.

The library provides a layer of simplicity, making it easier for developers to create complex 3D graphics without needing a deep understanding of the underlying WebGL code. This makes it an excellent choice for beginners and experts alike who are looking to incorporate 3D graphics into their web applications.

## Why choose three.js?
Here are the main reasons why developers prefer three.js for 3D web graphics:

- Simplicity: three.js abstracts much of the complexity of WebGL, making it easier for developers to create stunning 3D graphics with simpler, easier-to-   understand code.
- Documentation and Community: The library has extensive documentation and a large, supportive community, making it easier for developers to learn and 
  solve issues they encounter.
- Versatility and Features: three.js supports a wide range of features, including various lighting and shadowing techniques, shaders, post-processing 
  effects, and animations, among others. It allows developers to create a wide variety of 3D objects and scenes, from simple geometric shapes to complex 
  models and environments.

## Core Concepts in three.js
To get started with three.js, it is crucial to understand its core concepts:

1. Scene: This acts as the world or stage where all 3D objects exist. It's like the universe that houses everything that you want to render.
2. Camera: The camera is the viewpoint from which the scene is observed. By moving the camera, developers can change the perspective from which 3D objects are viewed.
3. Renderer: This is the component that takes the scene and the camera and paints the final image onto the web page.
4. Geometry: This represents the shape of 3D objects. Geometries can be as simple as a box or a sphere, or they can be complex models imported from a 3D modeling software.
5. Materials: These are used to define the appearance of the geometry in terms of color, texture, shininess, and how it responds to light.
6. Light: Light in a three.js scene mimics the behavior of light in the real world. Different types of light sources such as AmbientLight, DirectionalLight, PointLight, and SpotLight can be used to achieve various lighting effects.
7. Animation: Three.js provides the ability to animate 3D objects, whether that's moving a camera, changing the properties of a material over time, or any number of other possibilities.
